# 42 Project: `fdf`

## Objective
In this project you will discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how
to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to
observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.  
You will also discover your first graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed
internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal
with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse. This project also introduces you to
“events” programming. Don’t forget to watch the e-learning videos!
